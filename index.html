<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p> If I am being honest, there really isn't that much about me that is interesting enough to have a whole paragraph about myself. I am 23 years old and live in Bolingbrook,
        just about 20 minutes away from campus. I am majoring in Criminal Justice with a minor in Cyber Security. My original hopes were to work for a government agency of some 
        kind (CIA, FBI, DEA, etc.) and that is why I added a kind of specialty to go along with my criminal justice degree.</p>
    
<h3> What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h3>

        <li> Interactive Websites with JavaScript</li></ul>
<h3> My Favorite Hobby</h3>

<p> Throughout the last 6-7 years, golf has easily become my favorite thing to do. No matter what kind of mood I am in, by the time the round is over, I feel completely better.       
        It is really surprising for anyone who knows me to believe that because I am a pretty impatient person when it comes to other things, but when I am out on the course, I just
        feel relaxed. I also wish I had started to play earlier on in my life rather than just two weeks before the start of my freshman year of high school.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Fun Fact</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> One of my greatest accomplishments is that I have gotten three hole-in-ones in golf. The first one was at <i> Bolingbrook Golf Club</i>, the second was at    
        <i>Mistwood Golf Club</i> and the last was just a month ago at <i>Crooked Tree</i>, a golf course in Northern Michigan.</p>
